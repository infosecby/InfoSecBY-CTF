Hello, Mr. Hacker!
I've managed to steal this backup from some careless novice Ruby developer. He thinks that this is secure password manager, lol. 
So, your task is clear: you should find out the admin user (name of the account is somehow connected with InfoSecBY), obtain this account and get the flag.
I've got the information that developer changed stuff like ip addresses, id, usernames and passwords, etc., so if you find them in the code, they will not help you. Still, I believe in you. Happy hacking!
