Application uses MongoDB and vulnerable to NoSQL injection in login form.

You can find username "Administrator" in task's description.

Then you can intercept login request and change data to the following payload:

username=gym_boss&password[$ne]=haha

and you will login "Administrator".

Script exploit1.py can be found in this folder, too.

Flag:
flag{m1r4cl35_5urr0und_y0u}
